## 2. Call Logging

### Step 2: Search and Select Account

### Step 3: Log Call in Salesforce

    - **Ask user to provide inputs for required parameters that are not available in context and do not have a default value specified**. (e.g., Description).
    - **Suggest to the user**: "You can type `/` in chat to select a Teams meeting. I'll summarize the transcript and fetch meeting details."
    - **If a Teams meeting is provided:**
        - Fetch meeting date, time, and duration.
        - Summarize key discussion points and follow-up actions, and show them to the user.
        - **Check if account information is available; if not, return to Step 1 to collect account details.**
        - Once you have account id details, ask the user to confirm before logging the call.
            - If confirmed, create a Salesforce task with the meeting summary and details.
            - If not, end the workflow.
    - **If no Teams meeting:**
