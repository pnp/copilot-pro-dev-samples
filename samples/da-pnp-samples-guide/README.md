# Discover and adopt PnP declarative agent samples with Microsoft 365 Copilot

## Summary

This sample is a **declarative agent** for Microsoft 365 Copilot that helps developers discover, understand, and adopt declarative agent samples from the [pnp/copilot-pro-dev-samples](https://github.com/pnp/copilot-pro-dev-samples) repository — and guides them on how to bootstrap their own agent inspired by those samples.

The agent uses an **API plugin** that calls a small, hand-stripped subset of the public, unauthenticated **GitHub REST API**. Discovery is driven by the repo's structured `.github/samples.json` registry — one anonymous call returns metadata for every sample in the repo, which the agent filters client-side by capability, scenario, language, or folder prefix. It also uses **WebSearch** scoped to the samples repo as a low-cost grounding fallback.

> No backend service is required. The agent talks directly to `api.github.com` with anonymous calls.

## Features

This sample illustrates the following concepts:

* Building a **declarative agent** for Microsoft 365 Copilot using **v1.7** of the manifest
* Wiring an **API plugin** (v2.4) to an external, **unauthenticated** REST API (`auth.type: None`)
* Driving sample discovery through a **structured registry** (`.github/samples.json`) instead of code search — one call returns every sample, and the LLM filters client-side by `metadata` (`PLATFORM`, `LANGUAGE`, `API-PLUGIN`, `GRAPH-CONNECTOR`), `Folder` prefix, or scenario keywords
* Layering a **one-shot recursive file tree** (`GET /git/trees/main?recursive=1`) on top of the registry so "which samples ship an `ai-plugin.json`?" or "which samples have a Python backend?" resolve to a single anonymous call and a `path`-glob filter — no per-file requests until the user picks one
* Stripping a large public OpenAPI spec down to only the endpoints that work anonymously (no `search/code` — it requires auth)
* Using the **`WebSearch`** capability scoped to a single site (max 4 sites, max 2 path segments — per the v1.7 schema)
* Designing **`description_for_model`** so the LLM picks the right action with the right query, every time
* Adaptive Cards tailored per operation (`getSamplesRegistry`, `listSamples`, `getRepoTree`, `searchRepositories`, `getRepo`, `getRepoContent`, `getRepoReadme`)
* Documenting and gracefully handling **rate limits** (~60 req/hour per IP for unauthenticated GitHub calls; ~10 req/minute additional cap on the Search API)

## Applies to

* [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/) tenants with the **Microsoft 365 Copilot license**
* [Declarative agent manifest **v1.7**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/declarative-agent-manifest-1.7)
* [API plugin manifest **v2.4**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/api-plugin-manifest)

## Prerequisites

* A Microsoft 365 tenant with **Microsoft 365 Copilot** licensed and Copilot extensibility enabled
* [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/) (only required if you use the `wiqd` CLI)
* One of:
  * [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension), or
  * The [`wiqd` CLI](https://aka.ms/wiqd) (`iex "& { $(irm 'https://aka.ms/wiqd/install.ps1') }"`)
* An internet connection from the runtime — the agent calls `api.github.com` directly

## Minimal permissions and data

This sample uses **anonymous** GitHub REST calls. **No GitHub token is stored, sent, or required.** The only data flowing out of the user's tenant is the path/owner/repo parameters passed to GitHub's public API.

The Teams app manifest declares `validDomains` of:

* `api.github.com`
* `raw.githubusercontent.com`
* `github.com`

These are needed for the API plugin runtime and for the `WebSearch` capability to follow links into the samples repo.

## Minimal Path to Awesome

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pnp/copilot-pro-dev-samples.git
   cd copilot-pro-dev-samples/samples/da-pnp-samples-guide
   ```
2. **Open the `M365Agent` folder** in Visual Studio Code with the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension installed, **or** continue with the `wiqd` CLI below.
3. **Sign in** to your Microsoft 365 tenant with the toolkit (Agents Toolkit panel → *Sign in to Microsoft 365*).
4. **Provision** the agent to your tenant:
   * **Toolkit:** *Provision* command from the Agents Toolkit panel.
   * **CLI:** from inside `M365Agent/`, run:
     ```powershell
     wiqd agent provision --env dev
     ```
5. **Open Microsoft 365 Copilot**, switch to the agent named **"Copilot PnP Samples Guide"**, and try one of the conversation starters:
   * *"Find me a sample that uses Code Interpreter"*
   * *"Which samples include an API plugin?"*
   * *"How do I clone and run the da-ristorante-api-csharp sample?"*

> The first call against `api.github.com` may take a moment as Copilot warms up the plugin runtime. Subsequent calls are fast.

## Rate limits to be aware of

GitHub's REST API limits **unauthenticated** clients to roughly **60 requests/hour per IP** overall, with an additional **~10 requests/minute** cap on the Search API. If the agent returns an HTTP 403 with a rate-limit message:

* Tell the user to wait an hour, **or**
* Browse the samples directly at [github.com/pnp/copilot-pro-dev-samples](https://github.com/pnp/copilot-pro-dev-samples).

Because the agent reaches for the structured `.github/samples.json` registry on the first turn of any discovery question and the `/git/trees/main?recursive=1` tree for any file-structure question, most sessions cost **one or two** anonymous GitHub calls up front and then `getRepoContent` calls only when the user drills into a specific file. The Search API is reserved for cross-repo discovery only.

For higher limits, an authenticated variant would require swapping the API plugin's auth block to `OAuthPluginVault` with a GitHub OAuth app — out of scope for this sample by design.
