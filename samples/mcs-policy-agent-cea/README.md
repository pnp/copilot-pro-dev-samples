# Policy Agent — Custom Engine Agent with Salesforce Escalation

## Summary

A **Custom Engine Agent (CEA)** built in **Microsoft Copilot Studio** that handles both summary-level and detailed clause-level policy queries. Quick / overview questions are answered from a **SharePoint** knowledge source; "give me the full details" requests are escalated to **Salesforce Knowledge** via an Agent Flow.

## Problem Statement

Employees need varying levels of policy information — from quick summaries to detailed clause-level specifics. Common challenges:

* Simple queries require quick answers from SharePoint
* Complex queries need deeper investigation and expert assistance
* No seamless handoff between self-service and expert support
* Difficulty accessing detailed policy clauses and exceptions

## Solution Overview

A **Custom Engine Agent (CEA)** in Copilot Studio with SharePoint integration and Salesforce escalation:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Custom Engine Agent** | Handles both summary and detailed policy queries |
| **SharePoint Integration** | Primary knowledge source for policy documents |
| **Salesforce Escalation** | API-based escalation for detailed clause-level assistance |
| **Agent Flows** | Workflow automation for seamless escalation |

## Technical Details

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Platform** | Microsoft Copilot Studio |
| **Agent Type** | Custom Engine Agent (CEA) |
| **Knowledge Sources** | SharePoint folders dedicated to policy documents |
| **Integration Logic** | SharePoint for primary queries, Salesforce API via Agent Flows for escalation |
| **Escalation Trigger** | Requests for in-depth information (e.g., "Give me more details") |

The agent maps user intent (e.g. *finance*, *leave*, *security*, *operations*) to one of four Salesforce Knowledge Article titles:

* `KK-Enterprises Finance Policy Handbook`
* `KK-Enterprises Human Resources Policy Handbook`
* `KK-Enterprises IT & Security Policy Handbook`
* `KK-Enterprises Operations & Administration Policy Handbook`

The **Salesforce Detail Flow** is triggered only when "detail intent" keywords are detected: *details, full policy, complete, clauses, exceptions, eligibility, step-by-step, examples, evidence required, documentation*.

## Sample Prompts

* "How many paid holidays do employees get per year?"
* "List the exceptions mentioned in the travel reimbursement policy"
* "What is the approval process for expense claims over $500?"
* "Give me more details about the parental leave policy" *(triggers Salesforce escalation)*

## Business Value

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Reduced Retrieval Time** | Quick access to policy information from SharePoint |
| **Faster Query Resolution** | Immediate answers for common questions |
| **Optimized Access** | Smart routing between short summaries and detailed info |
| **Seamless Escalation** | Automatic handoff to Salesforce for complex queries |

## Prerequisites

* Microsoft 365 tenant with **Copilot Studio** license
* A **SharePoint site** containing the organization's policy documents
* A **Salesforce** instance with Knowledge articles and API access (used by the escalation flow)
* [Microsoft Power Platform CLI (`pac`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction)
* (Optional) [VS Code Copilot Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-CopilotStudio.vscode-copilotstudio) for source-control editing

## Minimal path to awesome

Import this sample into your Copilot Studio environment using the Power Platform CLI.

* Ensure you are authenticated with `pac auth`:

  ```powershell
  pac auth create --environment <your-env-id>
  pac auth who
  ```

* From this sample folder, package the unpacked solution into a zip:

  ```powershell
  cd samples/mcs-PolicyAgentCEA

  # Package up the solution. The SRC folder is what gets packed.
  pac solution pack --zipfile PolicyAgentCEA.zip --folder ./src
  ```

* Import into your chosen environment (omit `--environment` to use the default):

  ```powershell
  pac env list
  pac solution import --path ./PolicyAgentCEA.zip --environment <your-env-id> --publish-changes --activate-plugins
  ```

* After import, in [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com):
  1. Open the **Policy Agent (CEA)** in your solution.
  2. Configure the **SharePoint** knowledge source with the URL of your policy site.
  3. Configure the **Salesforce** connection used by the `SalesforceFlow` Agent Flow (Connector → Salesforce).
  4. Publish to your channel of choice (Microsoft Teams, M365 Copilot, custom).

## Features

This sample extends Copilot Studio with an agent that:

* Uses a **Custom Engine Agent** to handle two retrieval tiers: SharePoint for summaries, Salesforce for full policy text.
* Maps user intent to one of four Salesforce Knowledge Article titles for deterministic routing.
* Triggers a **Salesforce Agent Flow** only when detail-intent keywords are detected.
* Returns answers with a **citation footer** (`Source: SharePoint / Salesforce`) and includes `EffectiveDate` + `Version` when sourced from Salesforce.
* Redacts confidential / PII content and refuses out-of-scope queries.
