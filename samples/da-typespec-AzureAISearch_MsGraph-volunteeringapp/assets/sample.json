      "This sample demonstrates how to build a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot that allows you to find and apply for volunteer opportunities using Microsoft 365 Copilot with SharePoint List and Azure Ai Search integration and authentication. The agent will first ask what kind of volunteering you wish to do. Once decided it will submit your application to the selected opportunity. A key point of emphasis on this agent was making use of multiple Microsoft services using different APIs. The agent uses Microsoft Graph API to get the list of tasks assigned to the user and Azure AI Search to get the list of volunteer opportunities. The agent is built using the Microsoft Teams Toolkit."
