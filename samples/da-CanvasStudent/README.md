# Canvas Student declarative agent with API Plugin

## Summary

The Canvas Student agent is an AI-powered assistant integrating Microsoft 365 Copilot or Copilot Chat and the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS). It enables learners to combine information in Canvas with unique M365 apps capabilities. Learners can retrieve courses, modules, assignments, pages, announcements, and discussions from Canvas, and leverage features in M365 apps like BizChat, Word, and PowerPoint. Learners can search through course content, generate ideas for learning, and improve the overall learning experience.

### Evaluation

- All response generation features of this agent were tested, measured, and validated internally
- [How declarative agents are evaluated?](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/transparency-faq-declarative-agent#how-were-declarative-agents-evaluated-what-metrics-are-used-to-measure-performance)
- It's important to keep in mind that the output this agent provides can be inaccurate, incorrect, or out of date

## Prerequisites

The agent requires a working Canvas environment and access to Copilot Chat:

- API Developer Key in Canvas
- Microsoft 365 tenant with [custom app upload enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)
- Microsoft 365 A1, A3, or A5 license
- Agents work in Copilot Chat (both metered/no metered usage) and M365 Copilot, [learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#agent-capabilities-for-microsoft-365-users)
- Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code
  - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/tools-prerequisites#create-a-free-microsoft-365-developer-account)
  - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/microsoft-365-agents-toolkit-cli)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20 (optional for running in local dev machine)
- Admin permissions in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to distribute the agents to 
other users (optional)

## Minimal path to awesome

### 1. Create API Developer Key in Canvas

1. Follow the [steps](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-developer-API-key-for-an-account/ta-p/259) to create a developer API key for Canvas LMS
  (Note: The key name will show on the user sign in window.)
1. Enable the **Enforce Scopes** toggle and select the following scopes for the agent to have **GET** access:
    - `url:GET|/api/v1/courses`
    - `url:GET|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/modules`
    - `url:GET|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/modules/:module_id/items`
    - `url:GET|/api/v1/courses/:course_id/smartsearch`
    - `url:GET|/api/v1/users/:id`
2. In the **Redirect URIs** field, add `https://teams.microsoft.com/api/platform/v1.0/oAuthRedirect`

Saving will generate the **id** and **key** values that will be used for creating the OAuth registration in Microsoft Teams Developer Portal. Microsoft 365 Copilot will use these values to authenticate the agent with Canvas.

### 2. Add Canvas environment to agent

1. Clone this repository (or download this solution as a .ZIP file then unzip it)
2. Open the **da-CanvasStudent** folder in VS Code
3. In the **env** folder, open **.env.dev** file. Update the `CANVAS_BASE_URL` environment variable with the URL of your Canvas instance.

### 3. Provision and test the agent

In VS Code:

1. Select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left toolbar
2. In the Lifecycle section, select **Provision**
3. If prompted, sign in with your Microsoft 365 account and follow the prompts. Return to VS Code after signing in.
4. Enter the **id** generated in Step 1 for the **OAuth Client ID**
5. Enter the **key** generated in Step 1 for the **OAuth Client Secret**

> [!NOTE]
> The Canvas LMS client ID and client secret are stored locally in **env/.env.dev** and **env/.env.dev.user** files. The client secret is encrypted by Agents Toolkit and is not stored in the source code.

7. Once the provisioning is complete, you will see a message in the output window that the agent has been provisioned successfully.
8. Launch the agent in a new browser window by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd>.

In Microsoft 365 Copilot:

- Select any conversation starter, or ask about courses, modules, assignments, discussions, or announcements.
- Send your message to the agent.

> [!TIP]
> This step only installs the agent for you, move to the next section to distribute it across your institution

## Optional configuration

### 1. Deploy the agent to your organization

This step is only needed if you want to distribute the agent across your institution.

1.  Select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar
2.  In the **Utility** section, click **Zip Teams App Package** to download the file.
3.  Open a browser and naviagte to the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com). Go to **Settings** , select **Integrate apps**, and select **Upload custom apps**.
4.  Define which users or groups will have access to the agent, accept permissions and deploy

> [!TIP]
> Learn more at [Manage agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps?view=o365-worldwide)

### 2. Add capabilities and knowledge sources

This step is only needed if you want to add other capabilities and knowledge sources to your agent.
- Customize the agent with capabilities and knowledge sources to address your needs, including:
  - Code interpreter
  - Image generator
  - Web search
  - Scoped web search
  - Copilot connectors
  - SharePoint and OneDrive as knowledge
- Add your capabilities and knowledge sources to the [Capabilities object](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/declarative-agent-manifest-1.3#capabilities-object) in the `declarativeAgent.json` file
- Check the [capabilities and knowledge sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/add-agent-capabilities) for the latest capabilities

### 3. Setup Microsoft SSO in Canvas

This step is only needed if you want to enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Canvas with their Microsoft Entra accounts.

- An authentication provider can be added in Canvas through Admin > Authentication
- [Configuring Microsoft OAuth for Canvas Authentication](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Integration-Documents/Configuring-Microsoft-OAuth-for-Canvas-Authentication/ta-p/606219)
- Once a provider has been saved in Canvas, the provider’s authentication login credentials must be added to each Canvas user’s account via either two options:
  - [SIS CSV](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.sis_csv.html)
  - [Logins API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/logins.html)
